# Binary Tree Project

This project implements various operations on binary trees in C.

## Files:

- **binary_trees.h**: Header file containing function prototypes and struct definitions.
  
- **binary_tree_print.c**: Helper functions to print binary trees.

- **0-binary_tree_node.c**: Create a new binary tree node.

- **1-binary_tree_insert_left.c**: Insert a new node as the left child.

- **2-binary_tree_insert_right.c**: Insert a new node as the right child.

- **3-binary_tree_delete.c**: Delete an entire binary tree.

- **4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c**: Check if a node is a leaf.

- **5-binary_tree_is_root.c**: Check if a node is the root.

- **6-binary_tree_preorder.c**: Traverse a tree in preorder.

- **7-binary_tree_inorder.c**: Traverse a tree in inorder.

- **8-binary_tree_postorder.c**: Traverse a tree in postorder.

- **9-binary_tree_height.c**: Calculate the height of a binary tree.

- **10-binary_tree_depth.c**: Calculate the depth of a node in a binary tree.

- **11-binary_tree_size.c**: Calculate the size (number of nodes) of a binary tree.

- **12-binary_tree_leaves.c**: Count the leaves in a binary tree.

- **13-binary_tree_nodes.c**: Count the nodes with at least one child in a binary tree.

- **14-binary_tree_balance.c**: Calculate the balance factor of a binary tree.

- **15-binary_tree_is_full.c**: Check if a binary tree is full.

- **16-binary_tree_is_perfect.c**: Check if a binary tree is perfect.

- **17-binary_tree_sibling.c**: Find the sibling of a node in a binary tree.

- **18-binary_tree_uncle.c**: Find the uncle of a node in a binary tree.

## How to Use:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Compile the source files:

   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./binary_trees
   ```

4. Follow the instructions to test different binary tree operations.

## Example Usage:

```c
#include "binary_trees.h"

int main(void)
{
    /* Create a sample binary tree and test various operations */

    return 0;
}
```
